Hi! In this video you'll be learning about life annuities, their basic types and specifics.

## Recalling annuity certain

- An annuity is a finite set of level sequential cash flows.

- An annuity certain is an annuity payable for definite period of time.

         C1 = C2 = C3 = C4 = C5 = $1000
         i = 5%

         PV = PV(C1) + PV(C2) + PV(C3) + PV(C4) + PV(C5)

`@script`
Let's quickly remember what an annuity is. 
An annuity is a regular series of payments, so we can define it as a finite set of sequential cash flows. 
An annuity certain is an annuity payable for definite period of time, so the payments do not depend on some factor, such as whether a person is alive or not. Let's imagine we have an annuity certain that pays $1000 at the end of each period during 5 years and assume that annual rate of interest equals to 5%.
So, the present value of this annuity is simply the sum of present values of each payments.

## What is a life annuity?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ae206461ae"
```

`@part1`
**A life annuity is an annuity paid while the purchaser (or annuitant) is alive.**

- Whole life insurance is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date.

- Term life insurance is a life insurance that provides coverage at a fixed rate of payments for a limited period of time, the relevant term. After that period expires, coverage at the previous rate of premiums is no longer guaranteed and the client must either forgo coverage or potentially obtain further coverage with different payments or conditions.


`@script`
So, what is a life annuity?
A life annuity is an annuity, or series of payments at fixed intervals, paid while the purchaser is alive. 
There are 2 major types of life insurance: whole life and term.
Whole life insurance is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date. As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies.
Term life insurance is a life insurance that provides coverage at a fixed rate of payments for a limited period of time, the relevant term. After that period expires, coverage at the previous rate of premiums is no longer guaranteed and the client must either forgo coverage or potentially obtain further coverage with different payments or conditions. If the life insured dies during the term, the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary.

## Survival and death probabilities

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "994a1a2230"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
- p - survival probability

- q - death probability



| Age           | p             | q    |      
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|
| 40            | 0.95          | 0.05  |
| 41            | 0.9           | 0.1   |
| 42            | 0.85          | 0.15


`@script`
From the previous definitions it became clear that for the calculation of the PV of life annuities we would also need a survival probability and a death probability.
The survival probability is the proportion of units that survive beyond a specified time. 
Let's imagine we have the following survival & death probabilities data. So, f.e. 0.9 is the probability that a person aged 41 will survive the next year to age 42.
Let's also think of a term life annuity for this person aged 40 and the term is 2 years.

## Actuarial PV

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "83b8bedb77"
```

`@part1`
C1 = C2 = $1000
      i = 5%
      APV = APV(C1) + APV(C2), where

`@script`
Let's assume we have an equal cash flows at $1000. Annual rate of interest is 5%.
So, actuarial PV of the annuity is the sum of actuarial PVs of each cash flow, where Actuarial PV of the 1st cash flow is the ordinary PV of the cash flow times the probability that the person will survive the next year and will die a year after.
